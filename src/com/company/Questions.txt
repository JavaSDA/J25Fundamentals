10 mins
Declare and Initialize 2 variables of each together (and declare and initialize the last one separately)
of the data types we just discussed and print out 1 of each of the variables using the println method.

25 mins.
Write boolean expressions for the following:
 1. 10 + 11 > 25
 2. 22 * 6 < 58
 3. 10 > 9
 4. 11 < 5

 save your results to a variable and print out appropriate messages for the
 expressions using if-else statements. Also print out appropriate messages
 for these numbers: 3, 4 (negate them); For example:

 Not (10 > 9)
